HermesIntf.dll should be saved to the SkimSrv program directory. 
e.g. C:\Program Files (x86)\Afreet\SkimSrv 
(see http://www.dxatlas.com/skimserver/)

HPSDR Protocol v2 is now supported.Tnx N1GP

The Interface will attach to the SDR that responds first to the Discovery
Packet. However, it's possible to "lock" the DLL to a particular MAC or 
IP address.  To do that HermesIntf.dll should be renamed as follows:

HermesIntf_<sdr ip addres>.dll 
e.g.   HermesIntf_192.168.111.222.dll

-or-

HermesIntf_<last 2 bytes of the MAC>.dll  
eg.  HermesIntf_693c.dll, HermesIntf_0B63.dll etc

This is useful if you have multiple boards.  Note CWSL_Tee.dll works only with
the MAC address filters.  You can save multiple copies of the DLL in the skimserver 
directory for connecting to different SDRs. They will appear as separate entries 
in the Receiver dropdown list

The ADC overload is managed using the following algorithm:
In case of an ADC overflow  the step attenuator is incremented by one db every
100ms until the overload goes away or we run out of the attenuation range.   In
the absence of overload the attenuator is decreased 1db every 10s, until it's
back to zero or the overflow bit re-appears. In a high power environment the ATT
will "teeter" +/-1db every 10s...

PTT bit:
Samples with the PTT bit ON are not sent the skimmer and the ADC overflow is
ignored.  This prevents the skimmer from starting too many threads and trying to
decode junk. also keeps CPU and memory consumption under control.  If you TX on
another radio while the skimmer server is running, you can tie its PTT-out to
pin 26 on the Hermes J16 connector.   



Not yet implemented:
- a small GUI window with status info
- warning on packet loss or ADC overload


With the RBN aggregattor software you can monitor the quality of your spots by
telnetting to:

 telnet arcluster.reversebeacon.net 7000

Set cluster filter to: set/dx/filter spotter=yourcall

Merucry/Angelia support -  should work but I no reports yet
